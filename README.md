# DMBAR-Resolution
Dynamic modular bus assignment and reconfiguration problem resolution using RL
This repository implements a Dynamic Modular Bus Assignment Reinforcement Learning (DMBA-RL) environment and training framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in PyTorch.
The goal is to simulate and optimize real-time modular bus operations in a directed transportation network, where modular vehicles can split, merge, or reject passenger requests dynamically to minimize system-wide operational costs.
